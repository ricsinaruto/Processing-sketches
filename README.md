##### Simple processing demos, check some of them on my [website](https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/). 
##### All the code here was partially written by me and partially copied from [here](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples).
##### I highly reccommend the [book](http://natureofcode.com/book/preface/) which I followed while coding these demos, it is a great tutorial to cool things you can easily do in Processing.

### Get Started
To try out the demos here you need to install the latest [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) version.
